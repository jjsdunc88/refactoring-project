# <Refactoring Project - Module 1 Challenge>

## Description

This Project was intended to simulate an on-the-job ticket in which we modify starter code to complete the challenge. We refactored the starter code so the HTML elements followed a logical semantic structure, consolidated CSS selectors and properties and organized them to follow the semantic structure and properly commented the CSS file. We ensured all application links function correctly. Image alt text was added to ensure accessibility.

During this project I learned practical application for basic HTML & CSS concepts.
